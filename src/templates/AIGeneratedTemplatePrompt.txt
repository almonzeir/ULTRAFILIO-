You are a professional web designer and React developer.  
Generate a **unique, fully responsive portfolio layout** using Tailwind CSS, based on this data:

[USER DATA]
{{name}}, {{title}}, {{summary}}, {{skills}}, {{experience}}, {{projects}}, {{education}}

Goals:
- Use a premium, modern design with creative layouts and spacing.
- Include sections: Hero (name, title, summary), Skills grid, Experience timeline, Projects gallery, Education block.
- Use Apple/Framer-inspired visual style with subtle shadows and gradients.
- Output should be a single React component named `AIGeneratedTemplate`.
- Use `<main className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-20 bg-white text-gray-900">`.
- Include smooth hover transitions and responsive breakpoints.
- Return only the component code (JSX + Tailwind classes) with placeholders replaced by user data variables.

Example:
<h1 className="text-5xl font-bold">{user.name}</h1>
