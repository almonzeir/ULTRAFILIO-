# 🎨 Modern Template REDESIGNED

## ✨ The New "Glass & Glow" Look

I have completely transformed the **Modern Template** into a high-end, award-winning style portfolio. It is no longer "basic".

### 🚀 Key Visual Features:
1.  **3D Tilt Hero Image**: The profile photo now sits in a glass card that tilts in 3D when you hover over it.
2.  **Animated Background**: Soft, moving gradient blobs (purple/blue/cyan) that breathe life into the page.
3.  **Glassmorphism Everywhere**: Cards have a frosted glass effect with subtle borders.
4.  **Timeline Experience**: Employment history is now a connected timeline with glowing dots.
5.  **Hover Reveal**: Project cards have a beautiful gradient overlay that reveals a "View Project" button on hover.

### 📸 Photo Issue Status:
- **FIXED**: The `ModernTemplate` logic was explicitly updated to render the photo URL if it exists.
- **Backfill**: Note that portfolios created *before* the fix 5 minutes ago might still be missing the photo. Please create a **NEW** one to see the full magic.

### 🔗 How to See It?
1.  Go to `http://localhost:9003/demo-template`
2.  Make sure "✨ Modern" is selected.
3.  **Enjoy the view!**

### ⏭️ What's Next?
If you love this level of quality, I will give the same "Pro treatment" to the **Executive Template** next. 

**Shall I proceed to the Executive Template?**
